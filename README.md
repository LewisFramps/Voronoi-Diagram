# Voronoi-Diagram
Another test of git, just uploading a piece of uni work

Description (credit wikipedia (CAUSE THIS ISN'T MARKED))
>In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells.

Where can I see it working?
